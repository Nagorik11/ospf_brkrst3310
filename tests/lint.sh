# File:    lint.sh
# Version: Bash 3.2.57(1)
# Author:  Nicholas Russo (http://njrusmc.net)
# Purpose: First-stage CI check to ensure lab topology device
#          configurations are free from defects, or common styling errors
#          (including attribution). It prints out when linting starts
#          and ends, plus the name of each file discovered for linting.
#          Only files ending in '.md' are candidates for markdown linting,
#          and only files ending in '.txt' are candidates for config checking.
#          One integer CLI argument is supplied which identifies the expected
#          number of configuration files, to ensure none were forgotten.
#
rc=0 # Return code used to sum the rc from individual lint tests.
nf=0 # Number of files seen. Normal 'array length' isn't working.
#
echo "Config checking started"
for f in $(find . -name "R*.txt"); do
  # Print the filename, then use 'grep' to check for key information.
  echo "checking $f"
  # Make sure the author's name and email are clearly shown.
  grep -q "By Nicholas Russo <nickrus@cisco.com>" $f
  rc=$((rc + $?))
  # Make sure the router's hostname matches the file name.
  # Note that since the lab is built on a Windows machine, must match
  # \r\n Windows newline (Ctrl+V, Ctrl+M) at the end of the hostname.
